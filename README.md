# mri_brain_tumor_classification
The model used is a Deep Learning–based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) employing a supervised learning approach to perform multi-class medical image classification on a brain tumor mri dataset.

The brain tumor MRI classification project is implemented in two stages. The first stage uses a conventional CNN as the baseline model. In the second stage, a learning rate scheduler is applied during CNN training. Two different numbers of training epochs, 20 and 30 epochs, are used to analyze the effect of learning rate scheduling and training duration on model convergence, and classification performance.
